# Omni Analytics SDK

**Privacy-aware analytics that works automatically.**

Omni Analytics tracks user behavior on your website without manual instrumentation. After one initialization call, it automatically captures page views, clicks, sessions, and screen recordings. You control what gets tracked and can pause tracking anytime.

## What it tracks

Once initialized, the SDK automatically collects:

- **Page views** — every navigation and route change
- **Clicks** — what users interact with, where they click
- **Sessions** — anonymous user sessions with replay recordings
- **SPA navigation** — client-side routing (Next.js, React Router)

No manual event calls needed. It just works.

## Privacy controls

You decide what gets tracked:

- **Disable in development** — turn off tracking during local development
- **Protect sensitive elements** — exclude forms, payments, or auth pages from tracking
- **Mask sensitive text** — hide emails, addresses, or personal data in recordings

Tracking respects user privacy by default and gives you fine-grained control.
